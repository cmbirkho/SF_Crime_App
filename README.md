### This repository documents the work completed for the final course project of Developing Data Products on Coursera.


### There are two parts to the assignment:
1. Create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers
2. Create a reproducible pitch presentation about your application


### The application does the following:
- The user inputs the district and the month and hits submit
- San Francisco crime data is downloaded from [here](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783)
- If data is available per the user's selection the map displays those data points
- If data is available per the user's selection a prediction is generated to suggest the next type of crime that will be committed in that district during that month
