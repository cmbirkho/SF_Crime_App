### This repository documents the analysis and code used to host an app aimed at helping SF residents gain more insight into criminal activity within their neighborhoods.



### The application does the following:
- The user inputs the district and the month and hits submit
- San Francisco crime data is downloaded from [**here**](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783)
- If data is available per the user's selection the map displays those data points
- If data is available per the user's selection a prediction is generated to suggest the next type of crime that will be committed in that district during that month
