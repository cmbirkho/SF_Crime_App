UI:
-Tab 1: EDA 
-Tab 2: Inferential Stats
-Tab 3: Prediction
-Tab 4: data download capability
-Tab 5: Your Data tab (shows the data the user generated and what was collected)

Server:
-support a daily job of running and updating the SQLite database
-support interactive capabilities on all tabs


Process:
1. Need to do EDA and perform ETL on the dataset. What I discover/do here will be used in the application
- think about how we can set up the data to use a linear model (for speed on the server)



How often are incidents happening? Every X minutes
What's the distance between two incidents?
Based on the frequency of incidents and distance between points how many officers do you need on duty?

- Distance b/w current incident and next incident in your police district
- Resolve Speed: Time it takes to resolve an incident (report_datetime - incident_datetime)
- Assumption that 2 officers work together
- Travel Speed: Assumption that you can travel X meters per minute (something like that)
- Total Active Time = (Total Distance / avg travel speed) + total resolve speed
- Avg Resolve Time = (Total Distance / avg travel speed) + avg resolve speed
- Officers Needed = Total Active Time / Avg Resolve Time


on Summary Stats tab if incident_cnt = 0, do nothing and print out a messsage 


Do a classification machine learning problem. Determining if the crime 

Predict the next word to be written in the report

Make a new variable of officers on duty by using some logic. Probably need to transform the whole table 
-officers on duty at time of incident
    - min_to_nxt_incident
        - if there's not enough time/distance to get to the next incident within that district then you need another set of officers on duty
* then you could aggregate the table and predict how many officers are on duty by day of week, time of day, police district, mean min to nxt incident, mean ft to nxt incident


* predict the crime category based on the language used in the report description
** taking the description of something and telling you what label it should get
    - How does the user interact with this?
        - the user could do an ad lib deal. Select from various inputs to describe a crime and then the machine would label that crime
    - Does the user need to interact or is it more of a write-up?
    - User interaction tab + validation/write up tab
        - submit an incident description and the algo will classify that crime accordingly
        * could have a has to start with list to select from and end with and then you can enter what you want in the the middle
    - data flow
        - condense the bag of words model into 4 columns send to db -> pull and spread bag of words data and train model
