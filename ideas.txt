Show:
-EDA (charts, descriptive stats, distributions)
-Inferential Statistics
-Model Fitting
-Clean UI

UI:
-Tab 1: EDA 
-Tab 2: Inferential Stats
-Tab 3: Prediction
-Tab 4: data download capability
-Tab 5: Your Data tab (shows the data the user generated and what was collected)

Server:
-support a daily job of running and updating the SQLite database
-support interactive capabilities on all tabs


Process:
1. Need to do EDA and perform ETL on the dataset. What I discover/do here will be used in the application
- think about how we can set up the data to use a linear model (for speed on the server)
