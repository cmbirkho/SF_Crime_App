UI:
-Tab 1: EDA 
-Tab 2: Inferential Stats
-Tab 3: Prediction
-Tab 4: data download capability
-Tab 5: Your Data tab (shows the data the user generated and what was collected)

Server:
-support a daily job of running and updating the SQLite database
-support interactive capabilities on all tabs


Process:
1. Need to do EDA and perform ETL on the dataset. What I discover/do here will be used in the application
- think about how we can set up the data to use a linear model (for speed on the server)



How often are incidents happening? Every X minutes
What's the distance between two incidents?
Based on the frequency of incidents and distance between points how many officers do you need on duty?

- Distance b/w current incident and next incident in your police district
- Resolve Speed: Time it takes to resolve an incident (report_datetime - incident_datetime)
- Assumption that 2 officers work together
- Travel Speed: Assumption that you can travel X meters per minute (something like that)
- Total Active Time = (Total Distance / avg travel speed) + total resolve speed
- Avg Resolve Time = (Total Distance / avg travel speed) + avg resolve speed
- Officers Needed = Total Active Time / Avg Resolve Time
